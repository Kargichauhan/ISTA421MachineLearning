# ISTA421MachineLearning
I took this class during my exchange program. I visit The University of Arizona on Fall 2021.

Machine learning describes algorithms which can modify their internal parameters (i.e., "learn") to recognize patterns and make decisions based on examples or through interaction with the environment.  This course introduced the fundamentals of machine learning, described how to implement several practical methods for pattern recognition, feature selection, clustering, and decision making for reward maximization, and provided a foundation for the development of new machine learning algorithms.
